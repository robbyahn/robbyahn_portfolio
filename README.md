### CV

There are currently 2 different ways of generating the CV page content. The first one is by using a json file located in [assets/json/resume.json](assets/json/resume.json). It is a [known standard](https://jsonresume.org/) for creating a CV programmatically. The second one, currently used as a fallback when the json file is not found, is by using a yml file located in [\_data/cv.yml](_data/cv.yml). This was the original way of creating the CV page content and since it is more human readable than a json file we decided to keep it as an option.

What this means is, if there is no resume data defined in [\_config.yml](_config.yml) and loaded via a json file, it will load the contents of [\_data/cv.yml](_data/cv.yml) as fallback.
